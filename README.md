## modernToRoman Function info:
  Last time I applied for this position I was invited to do an interview with Mark and Dan and received some great criticism/advice about the code I had written which I took seriously and went back to my original code to study and improve on. Since then I improved my original code through practice and seeing what others had done. In that time I happened to be working on a personal practice project and had an idea on how to improve one section of my translator and after figuring it out in a messy way I looked for examples of others and stumbled upon what is very similar in my modernToRoman function.
To be honest I didn't expect the challenge to be the same as last time so it didn't even occur to me that it might give me a slight edge but I don't want to write a worse function as it is what I had discovered/learned. 

## Test Cases:
  ### modern -> roman Numerals:
    1738, 3999, 4, h, q, g, 0, -1, 9999, 4444 (and more that aren't as exciting)
  ### Menu
    C, V, I, d, a, f, d, -1, 0, 4, 5, 9000 (including smashing keyboard and all that is entered with that)
